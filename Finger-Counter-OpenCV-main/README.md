# ✋ Finger Counter — OpenCV + MediaPipe Project

A simple yet powerful AI-powered tool that counts how many fingers you're holding up using your webcam in real time!  
Built with **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe**, this project is a great starting point for learning gesture recognition.

## 🎯 What It Does

This project detects your hand and counts the number of fingers you're showing (from 0 to 5) using real-time webcam input.  
It then displays the finger count on the screen with a live overlay.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Real-time finger counting with **MediaPipe**  
✅ Displays the current number of fingers held up (0–5)  
✅ Detects both left and right hands  
✅ Easy to use — no setup beyond your webcam  
✅ Great for learning computer vision basics!
